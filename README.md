Samples of my work in VBA

Code sample: Pickup module, which automates the following tasks:

1) Gather a list of box numbers.
2) For each box, ensure the contents of the box are valid (same type, same year of closure, etc) by interfacing with the database and applying business rules.
3) Opens, fills, and saves the required Excel forms.
4) Emails the appropriate people, attaching the forms where necessary.
